This folder contains a zip file with a copy of CAPTURE.EXE (White et al., 1978; Rexstad and Burnham, 1992) obtained from Jay Barlow (NOAA SWFSC), which allows for a larger number of capture histories than the version available from the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center webpage for the CAPTURE program (https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/software/capture.shtml). The program CAPTURE was written to complement the Wildlife Monograph publication by Otis et al (1978). This version of CAPTURE includes several estimators not available in the original 1978 version, as detailed in the provided users guide (Rexstad and Burnham 1992).
